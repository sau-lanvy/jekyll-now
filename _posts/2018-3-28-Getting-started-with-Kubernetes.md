---

Kubernetes, well, it's one of, if not, the hottest container management technology out there, and it's got a future as bright

# What is Kubernetes?
### Where dit it come from?
Kubernetes was born at Google. But, in the summer of 2014 it came of age, and it was open-sourced and handed over to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which is a part of the Linux foundation. And to be fair, since then it has been nothing short of a rip-roaring success, like there's no doubt it's one of the biggest and most important open source infrastructure projects on the planet. Here are some more information about Kubernetes:

* Born in Google
* Become open source in 2014
* Written in Go/GoLang
* Source: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
* Channels: @kubernetesio, slack.k8s.io, https://kubernetes.io
* v1.0 July 2015
* Often shorttened name to k8s

### What does the name mean?
Kubernetes comes from the Greek word meaning helmsman, and the logo here, obviously, that's from the helm of a ship. And this should be no surprise, mean the whole Docker and containers world is just littered with nautical references. 

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes has a number of features. It can be thought of as:

* A container platform
* A microservices platform
* A portable cloud platform and a lot more.
